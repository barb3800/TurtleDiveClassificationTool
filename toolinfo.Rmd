# **Tool From**: *Barbour et al (in review), "Clustering and classification of vertical movement profiles for ecological inference of behavior"*

<font size="4"> We developed a generalizable classification tool for sea turtle dive profiles, using an image classifier convolutional neural network (CNN) and 5 classes of known dive shapes for sea turtles (Hochscheid 2014).

<font size="4"> This tool has been fully trained using these 5 standard dive shapes (A, C, D, E, and F) known for sea turtles in combination with a dataset of dive profiles from migrating leatherback turtles in the South Pacific ocean gyre (see Shillinger et al 2008, 2011 for original data descriptions).

## [Dive Classification Tool Link](https://robillarda-diveprofiler-streamlit-app-2c9i4f.streamlitapp.com/) *Click Here!*

<font size="4"> **To use**: *click the link and simply upload an image of a dive profile for a sea turtle (see example below). It will return the predicted shape class of the dive and certainty estimates. The tool can also handle large batches of dives (which is what it is intended for- to replace manual labeling of dives by their shapes!).*
